## **1\. Adidas - Run for the Oceans**

* **Campaign Name:** Run for the Oceans
* **Campaign Dates:** Annually since 2017
* **Industry:** Sportswear & Sustainability
* **Target Audience:** Runners, fitness enthusiasts, eco-conscious consumers

Adidas wanted to raise awareness about plastic waste in the ocean and get people involved actively. Instead of just donating money, they turned running into a movement. 

The goal was to make people feel connected to the problem and empowered to take action. Every mile people covered contributed to ocean cleanup.

To make this happen, Adidas partnered with an environmental organization focused on protecting marine life, Parley for the Oceans. They launched a global running challenge, and participants recorded their miles on the Runtastic app. 

For every kilometer run, Adidas donated money toward cleaning plastic from beaches and oceans. They promoted the campaign through social media, fitness influencers, and Adidas retail stores to get more people involved.

They also introduced sneakers made from recycled ocean plastic, making it even more impactful. That also gave customers a way to support the cause beyond running.
